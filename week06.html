Map to Artificial Nature, Haru Ji, 2011.


## Definition of AN
Haru Ji. 2011

>To create a novel form of installation art which constructs **an aesthetic unity in which art, science, play, and life integrate into a single fulfilled experience.**

>I propose the term **artificial nature** to denote computational artworks of complex systems creating worlds with their own physics and biology, which construct aesthetic experiences using the mechanisms and evolutionary processes of life within immersive, interactive environments.

>It is a research-oriented art form investigating the application of bio-inspired system theories towards engaging aesthetic worldmaking: to create ***nature-like*** **experiences as a contemporary art practice.**


## Life and life-like behaviors

>In order to construct life as an art work, an understanding regarding the **mechanisms and processes of life** is vital.

>For the purposes of constructing **a** ***nature-like*** **experience** using computational media, a physical correlate is less important however than the question of whether these models are capable of generating **life-like behavior: a model that can be made compatible with computation, expressible in terms of systems of mathematical relations or discretely causal procedures.** It is the ***behaviors*** and ***processes*** that are of interest of an artificial nature.

## What is *Life*?

- Actual definitions for what is life in terms of biological explanation remain a matter of theoretical speculation and debate as much as scientific proof (Nusslein-Volhard, 2006).

- Contemporary accounts of life usually mention characteristic features such as growth and development, reproduction, evolution and adaptation, responsiveness and autonomy, metabolism, self-organization and emergence to describe the concept of life (Boden, 2000)  

### Characteristics
- Order-from-order principle
- Negative entropy and code-script mechanism
- Irreversible dissipative system
- Life as an organized system 
- Autopoiesis, systems of relations 

## Life from Physics?
### Erwin Schrödinger (1887-1967)

![physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/images/schrodinger-12988-content-portrait-mobile-tiny.jpg)  

- Erwin Schrödinger posed the question ***What is Life*** originally published in 1944 (Schrödinger, 1968), achieving significant progress toward **understanding life in terms of the physics of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.**   

	- ***"Order-from-order" principle:*** life appears to defy the 2nd law of thermodynamics, which tell us, while all systems descend into chaos, in living systems, order is maintained and even increased over time. Nevertheless, if life is constructed of the same materials - atoms and molecules - as non-life, then ***the difference must inhere in the structure or organization*** of these atoms and molecules. 
	
	- Introduction of ***"negative entropy”:*** life evades entropic decay to equilibrium (and ultimately, death) by feeding up on sources of negentropy (negative entropy) in the environment, and directing them via an active code. Life depends on this ordered ***“code-script”*** to preserve the information from which it reconstructs and reproduces itself from generation to generation. 
	
### Ilya Prigogine (1917-2003)

![physics](https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1210964463p5/178375.jpg)  


- Prigogine’s ***far-from-equilibrium systems of “dissipative structures”*** providing a rigorous scientific basis for understanding ***irreversible*** physical systems. 	

- Life on Earth is a prime example of such a dissipative structure: an open system in a steady yet dynamic state, maintaining and reproducing its high levels of order and complexity through self-organization, feeding upon negentropy due to material and energetic fluxes received from outside (predominantly originating in the Sun) (Prigogine, 1984). 

## Life as an Organized System 
### Relational Biology 

![biology](http://edgeoforder.org/images/RosenRobert.jpg)    
Robert Rosen (1934-1998)

- In ***Life Itself*** (Rosen, 1991), Robert Rosen cast doubt on a reductionist explanation of life as being adequate: in the process of reducing an organism to its constituent parts or aspects, something essential to the life is lost: the whole can not be recovered once the biological organization is lost. His teacher, Nicolas Rashevsky considered it possible to “throw away the matter and keep the underlying organization” (Rashevsky, 1954)

### Autopoiesis

![biology](https://epistemologiaparaingenieros.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/maturana.jpg)  Humberto Maturana (1928- )
![biology](https://www.famousbirthdays.com/faces/varela-francisco-image.jpg) 
Francisco Varela (1946-2001)   

- Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela’s theory of ***Autopoiesis*** is another influential description of life in terms of systems of relations (Varela et al., 1974). 

	- ***An “autopoietic machine” is an organized unity of a network of processes***, which interact to continuously regenerate the unity of the whole, and constitute the concrete topological space over which this network of processes continues to realizes itself.   
	- The prime example of an autopoietic system is a biological cell, with its network of chemical reaction pathways and bounding membranes; as a closed self-producing, self-organized, self-preserving, and self-referential system (Reichle, 2010). 

## What is *Artificial Life?*
### Christopher G. Langton (1948- )

![biology](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Langtonsmall2.png/220px-Langtonsmall2.png) 

- The scientific field of Artificial Life, named in 1987 by Christopher Langton, takes the insight of relational biology one step further: ***if life is a property of organization, it may be a phenomenon which can be manifest regardless of the particular physical material of which it is made.*** In particular, computational simulation is a primary research method: understanding life by re-creating it in an alternative medium (Langton, 1989).  
- **Life made by man rather than by nature**

***"How can we recognize life other than life as we know it?"***

### Bio Art and A-Life Art

![alife](image/a_life/bioart.png)

## Life-as-it-could-be?
- ***life-as-it-could-be > life-as-it-know-it.***  
- Biology of possible life.

## A-Life art characteristics	

***"Is the creation of "life-as-it-could-be" or a computer simulation of A-Life a form of art?"*** 

- Artificial Life has a closer relationship with ***creativity*** due to its emphasis on emergence, and greater freedom due to the open-endedness of "life-as-it-could-be". 
	
	- The suffix “-as-it-could-be” indicates a shift in thought beyond the immediately apparent to the imaginable and possible: a shift which lies ***at the heart of exploratory creativity.***  
	
	- A-Life brings ***aesthetic concerns*** into science, to the evaluation and appreciation of its unexpected life-like creations. 
	
###  Bottom-up Approach
	
- The strategy of making possible complex phenomena by the simulation of simple components including such processes as evolution, development, and flocking. These demonstrations show remarkably life-like qualities, despite having been constructed from component relations that are distinctly non-biological. 

- Cellular automata is an example. 

## *“Art-as-it-could-be”*

- Australian researcher, artist, and educator Jon McCormack uses the term **‘Evolutionary Music and Art’ (EMA)** to describe the generation of music and art using creative evolutionary systems, and lists a collection of open problems for the field (McCormack, 2005). 

	![a_life](https://i.vimeocdn.com/portrait/1281598_300x300)
	Jon McCormack.

- The goal of EMA:
	- (i) research where the evolutionary music and art work is intended to be recognized by humans as creative and (ii) research which explores the concept of creativity in general.
	- Related to the second goal, McCormack paraphrases Langton’s "life-as-it-could-be" into ***"art-as-it-could-be",*** introducing its meaning as ***"artistic products or systems created and analyzed by synthetic autonomous agents".*** 
	
## “Art-as-it-could-be” in Artificial Nature	
- Artificial natures uses the same term but in a different way. In artificial natures the implication of "art-as-it-could-be" is **the expansion of the realm of current art.**

	- The evolving beauty of emergent complexity in an artificial nature is intrinsically man-made yet follows an understanding of the mechanisms of nature itself. As such it may emphasize the comparison and fusion of virtual and actual; provoking speculation on the concepts of creativity and beauty in both nature and culture, and expanding from ***edge of art into “art-as-it-could-be”.***

### VIDA Art and Artificial Life Internationa Awards
- [VIDA Art and Artificial Life Internationa Awards](https://vida.fundaciontelefonica.com/en/)  
The VIDA Art and Artificial Life International Awards was started in 1999 to support artistic investigation into artificial life and to promote production in this field. Its own particular framework, art and artificial life, forms part of that multidisciplinary territory where art, science and technology come together.
