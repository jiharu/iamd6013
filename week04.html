# Exercise 2: Working with Casey Reas and P5.js
## "Software is a unique medium with unique qalities."


## Software Structures
Inspired by Sol LeWitt's wall drawings, Casey Reas' *{Software} Structures* explores the relevance of conceptual art to the idea of software as art. Casey Reas created three unique structures—text descriptions outlining dynamic relations between elements—which were then implemented in association with Jared Tarbell, Robert Hodgin, and William Ngan. Each of them interpreted the textual structures to derive twenty-six software artworks.

> "The catalyst for this project is the work of Sol LeWitt, specifically his wall drawings. I had a simple question: 'Is the history of conceptual art relevant to the idea of software as art?'" explains Reas. "I began to answer the question by implementing three of Lewitt's drawings in software and then making modifications. After working with the LeWitt plans, I created three structures unique to software. These software structures are text descriptions outlining dynamic relations between elements. They develop in the vague domain of image and then mature in the more defined structures of natural language before any thought is given to a specific machine implementation. Twenty-six pieces of software derived from these structures were written to isolate different components of software structures including interpretation, material, and process. For each, you may view the software, source code, and comments."

{Software} Structures was restored in 2016 to work well with contemporary web browsers. The original software was created with Processing, which depends on Java applets that are no longer widely supported in web browsers. The updated version uses P5.js (a descendent of Processing using JavaScript) to be more accessible.

## Explorations of Sol LeWitt's wall drawings using P5.js
### P5 Editor
The p5.js Web Editor is an online platform for learning to code in a visual way. Designed for all ages and abilities, anyone can get started quickly creating, editing, and sharing p5.js sketches.  
It is free and open source, no sign up, setup, or download required. Using p5.js you can use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create graphics in 2D and 3D, add text, images, video, and audio, and make your sketch interactive with mouse, touch, webcam input, and motion sensing.  

[p5 editor link](https://editor.p5js.org/)  

### Codepen

CodePen is a playground for the front end side of the web. Need to build a reduced test case to demonstrate and figure out a bug? CodePen is great for that. Want to show off your latest creation and get feedback from your peers? CodePen is great for that. Want to find examples of a particular design pattern for your project? CodePen is great for that. - [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/about/)  

- Let's create an account. [codepen link](https://codepen.io/)
	
- Create a new pen. From the setting located at the top right of the screen, you can add P5.js library. Type "p5" and it should offer a full URL for the p5 library, which you can click to select. Then click save & close.

![codepen](image/codepen01.png)  

- Optional: You can check out the latest P5 version from [p5 website](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/p5.js). You can directly copy its address.

>Example - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.7.2/p5.min.js

- Optional: you can disable Auto-Updating Preview under Behavior in the setting box. The Run button will appear at the top right pannel. (Sometimes auto-updating can be distracting or cause the browser to crash due to an infinite loop while you are typing.)

	- P5 documentation: [https://p5js.org/download/](https://p5js.org/download/)
	- CODEPEN documentation: [https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/) 
	
- Test coding.
	- There are three text boxes: HTML, CSS, and JS (JavaScript). Mostly we will only use the JS box to enter code. 
	- Optional: Add the code below to the CSS box to get rid of scroll bar around your canvas:

```css
/* these styles remove the space & scrollbars around the canvas */  
body {margin:0; padding:0;}  
canvas {display:block;} 		
```

- Shrink the HTML and CSS boxes to have a bigger space in the JS box. 
- Test to write the simplest p5 script:
	
```javascript
function setup() {  
	// initialize the canvas & graphics state:  
	createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);  
	background(128);
}
```

- If you see the screen change its color to grey, you know that you're ready:
  	
![codepen](image/codepen02.png)  
  	
*Yeah~ Successful!*

- You may also want to open the browser console, where any errors will be printed. How to do this depends on what browser you use. E.g. in Chrome, it is under View / Developer > JavaScript Console. In Firefox it is Tools / Web Developer > Browser Console. [For other browsers see here.](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-do-i-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers)
 	
### P5 code 1: Sol LeWitt's wall drawing #118
	
![Sol LeWitt](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c1/5a/96/c15a96241205e287e75a77cc1bfc9c26--wall-drawing-conceptual-art.jpg) 

![solLeWitt](image/sol01.png)  
Modified from the rule: number of points from 50 to 100, and added blue lines to specify straight lines from a previous point to a new point. 

- For 15 mins, you are invited to code for the wall drawing #118. There is no single correct solution, therefore you can explore your own interpretation / approach. 

	
### P5 code 2: Sol LeWitt's wall drawing #273	

>Lines to points on a grid. A six-inch (15 cm) grid covering the wall. Lines from the corners, sides, and center of the walls to random points on the grid. Composite (seventh wall): red lines from the midpoints of four sides, blue lines from four corners, yellow lines from the center., 1975

![solLeWitt](image/sol02.png) 

- For 15 mins, you are invited to code for the wall drawing #273. There will be no single correct solution, therefore explore your own approach. 
	
### P5 code 3: Sol LeWitt's wall drawing #95 modified.

>On a wall (paper) divided vertically into fifteen equal parts, vertical lines, (not) straight, using four colors in all one-, two-, three-, and four-part combinations.	

![solLeWitt](image/sol03.png) 

- For 15 mins, you are invited to code for the wall drawing #95. There will be no single correct solution, therefore explore your own approach. 

### P5 code 4: animating elements

>**Element:**    
 	Form: circle.    
 	Behaviour 1: wander by a random walk.  
	Behaviour 2: if leaving one edge of the canvas, appear at the other edge of the canvas.  
>Specification and visualization: a canvas of several elements of varying size, initially placed at random. each element has a different speed. draw each element filled in white. you may also draw a faint line between each possible pair of elements.

### P5 code 5: process by Casey Reas
> Reas' Process series instructions listed [here](http://reas.com/compendium_text)

## Reference for javascript

Learining JavaScript resources:

### Object
An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.

We can imagine an object as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is stored in it’s file by the key. It’s easy to find a file by it’s name or add/remove a file.

- [https://javascript.info/object](https://javascript.info/object)

### Object literal syntax

Object literals are defined using the following syntax rules:  

- [http://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/object-literal/](http://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/object-literal/)  
- A colon separates property name from value.
- A comma separates each name-value pair from the next.
- There should be no comma after the last name-value pair.
