Process Compendium 2004-2010 is a collection of work and record of process by Casey Reas, co-founder of Processing, presented and created entirely in Processing. 

An Element is a simple machine that is comprised of a Form and one or more Behaviors. A Process defines an environment for Elements and determines how the relationships between the Elements are visualized. For instance, Element 1 takes the form of a circle and one of its behaviors moves it along a straight line at a constant speed. Process 4 fills a surface with Element 1 and draws a line between elements while they overlap. Each Process is a short text that defines a space to explore through multiple interpretations.

# Exercise 1: Working with Sol LeWitt
## "The idea becomes a machine that makes the art"
## Exploration
### Drawings based on rules
Follow the rules below. Complete your drawing on a given paper and post it to the class wall using masking tape. Don't forget to sign each work with your name.
	
- Drawing 1, [Sol LeWitt's wall drawing #95](http://massmoca.org/event/walldrawing95/), 1971 (15 mins): 
>On a wall (paper) divided vertically into fifteen equal parts, vertical lines, not straight, using four colors in all one-, two-, three-, and four-part combinations.
>
Material: Colored pencil on white paper
>
Centre Pompidou, Paris
Musée national d’art moderne/Centre de création industrielle

- Drawing 2, Sol LeWitt's wall drawing #118, 1971 (15 mins):
	
	![Sol LeWitt's wall drawing #118](https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/lewitt.jpg?quality=80)

### Creating your rules
- (20 min): each participant should create directions for a drawing. The artist may stipulate the media, size, tool(s), color(s), shape(s), placement of all elements, or only some. Follow your rules to draw one by yourself, then post your rule (not your drawing) onto the wall.

- (20 min) : Choose a rule from the wall which a fellow artist created, and copy that rule (you can take a photo). Then create a drawing based on it. Once you are done, post your drawing under your chosen rule.

## Sol LeWitt	

**Sol LeWitt** (b.1928, Hartford, CT; d. 2007, New York) was a leading figure of Minimalism and pioneer of Conceptual art. 
LeWitt has been the subject of numerous one-artist exhibitions and his work is held in public collections worldwide. In 2008, MASS MoCA opened [Sol LeWitt: A Wall Drawing Retrospective](http://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/), which will remain on view through 2033.

- Sol Lewitt's CV from [Lisson Gallery](http://www.lissongallery.com/artists/sol-lewitt).

- [Sol LeWitt exhibition at Paula Cooper Gallery](https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/sol-lewitt-2016-09-08/installation-views)


LeWitt began to create works that utilized simple and impersonal geometric forms, exploring repetition and variations of a basic form or line as a way to achieve complex works. Perhaps most importantly, he evolved a working method for creating artworks based on simple directions, works that could be executed by others rather than the artist. The fertility of this approach is demonstrated by the aesthetic richness and variety of the wall drawings, none of which were drawn by him. LeWitt rejects the notion of art as a unique and precious object. Formulated from an initial idea outlined in a diagrammatic sketch accompanied by a set of instructions, his works are installed on the wall of the gallery or museum by a team of assistants, who rigorously follow the artist’s directives. Some instructions are simple and straightforward, and some are long and complex. By placing his drawings directly on the wall of the gallery or museum, LeWitt merges his drawing with the architecture, while also calling into questions ideas about permanence, value, and conservation. *- This description from [Guggenheim museum.](https://www.guggenheim.org/arts-curriculum/topic/sol-lewitt)*

>LeWitt's wall drawings are executed by assistants from the artist's instructions. In this work, the lines are all equally spaced and drawn in coloured pencil. Each colour corresponds to a different type of line: yellow for horizontal, black for vertical, red for diagonal from left to right, and blue for diagonal from right to left. The lines are drawn in all possible combinations in fifteen rectangles, becoming denser from left to right. Through this layering, new colours and complex patterns emerge from LeWitt's simple set of rules.

## Sol LeWitt's thought
> **When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.**  

>**The ideas need not be complex. Most ideas that are successful are ludicrously simple. Successful ideas generally have the appearance of simplicity because they seem inevitable. In terms of ideas the artist is free even to surprise himself. Ideas are discovered by intuition.**

>**To work with a plan that is preset is one way of avoiding subjectivity. It also obviates the necessity of designing each work in turn. The plan would design the work. Some plans would require millions of variations, and some a limited number, but both are finite. Other plans imply infinity.** 

>**When an artist uses a multiple modular method he usually chooses a simple and readily available form. The form itself is of very limited importance; it becomes the grammar for the total work. In fact, it is best that the basic unit be deliberately uninteresting so that it may more easily become an intrinsic part of the entire work. Using complex basic forms only disrupts the unity of the whole. Using a simple form repeatedly narrows the field of the work and concentrates the intensity to the arrangement of the form. This arrangement becomes the end while the form becomes the means.**

>**If the artist carries through his idea and makes it into visible form, then all the steps in the process are of importance. The idea itself, even if not made visual, is as much a work of art as any finished product. All intervening steps –scribbles, sketches, drawings, failed works, models, studies, thoughts, conversations– are of interest.  Those that show the thought process of the artist are sometimes more interesting than the final product.**

# Exercise 2: Working with Casey Reas and P5.js
## "Software is a unique medium with unique qalities."


## Software Structures
Inspired by Sol LeWitt's wall drawings, Casey Reas' *{Software} Structures* explores the relevance of conceptual art to the idea of software as art. Casey Reas created three unique structures—text descriptions outlining dynamic relations between elements—which were then implemented in association with Jared Tarbell, Robert Hodgin, and William Ngan. Each of them interpreted the textual structures to derive twenty-six software artworks.

> "The catalyst for this project is the work of Sol LeWitt, specifically his wall drawings. I had a simple question: 'Is the history of conceptual art relevant to the idea of software as art?'" explains Reas. "I began to answer the question by implementing three of Lewitt's drawings in software and then making modifications. After working with the LeWitt plans, I created three structures unique to software. These software structures are text descriptions outlining dynamic relations between elements. They develop in the vague domain of image and then mature in the more defined structures of natural language before any thought is given to a specific machine implementation. Twenty-six pieces of software derived from these structures were written to isolate different components of software structures including interpretation, material, and process. For each, you may view the software, source code, and comments."

{Software} Structures was restored in 2016 to work well with contemporary web browsers. The original software was created with Processing, which depends on Java applets that are no longer widely supported in web browsers. The updated version uses P5.js (a descendent of Processing using JavaScript) to be more accessible.

## Explorations of Sol LeWitt's wall drawings using P5.js
### P5 Editor
The p5.js Web Editor is an online platform for learning to code in a visual way. Designed for all ages and abilities, anyone can get started quickly creating, editing, and sharing p5.js sketches.  
It is free and open source, no sign up, setup, or download required. Using p5.js you can use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create graphics in 2D and 3D, add text, images, video, and audio, and make your sketch interactive with mouse, touch, webcam input, and motion sensing.  

[p5 editor link](https://editor.p5js.org/)  

### Codepen

CodePen is a playground for the front end side of the web. Need to build a reduced test case to demonstrate and figure out a bug? CodePen is great for that. Want to show off your latest creation and get feedback from your peers? CodePen is great for that. Want to find examples of a particular design pattern for your project? CodePen is great for that. - [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/about/)  

- Let's create an account. [codepen link](https://codepen.io/)
	
- Create a new pen. From the setting located at the top right of the screen, you can add P5.js library. Type "p5" and it should offer a full URL for the p5 library, which you can click to select. Then click save & close.

![codepen](image/codepen01.png)  

- Optional: You can check out the latest P5 version from [p5 website](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/p5.js). You can directly copy its address.

>Example - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.7.2/p5.min.js

- Optional: you can disable Auto-Updating Preview under Behavior in the setting box. The Run button will appear at the top right pannel. (Sometimes auto-updating can be distracting or cause the browser to crash due to an infinite loop while you are typing.)

	- P5 documentation: [https://p5js.org/download/](https://p5js.org/download/)
	- CODEPEN documentation: [https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/) 
	
- Test coding.
	- There are three text boxes: HTML, CSS, and JS (JavaScript). Mostly we will only use the JS box to enter code. 
	- Optional: Add the code below to the CSS box to get rid of scroll bar around your canvas:

```css
/* these styles remove the space & scrollbars around the canvas */  
body {margin:0; padding:0;}  
canvas {display:block;} 		
```

- Shrink the HTML and CSS boxes to have a bigger space in the JS box. 
- Test to write the simplest p5 script:
	
```javascript
function setup() {  
	// initialize the canvas & graphics state:  
	createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);  
	background(128);
}
```

- If you see the screen change its color to grey, you know that you're ready:
  	
![codepen](image/codepen02.png)  
  	
*Yeah~ Successful!*

- You may also want to open the browser console, where any errors will be printed. How to do this depends on what browser you use. E.g. in Chrome, it is under View / Developer > JavaScript Console. In Firefox it is Tools / Web Developer > Browser Console. [For other browsers see here.](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-do-i-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers)

### Object
An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.

We can imagine an object as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is stored in it’s file by the key. It’s easy to find a file by it’s name or add/remove a file.

- [https://javascript.info/object](https://javascript.info/object)

### Object literal syntax

Object literals are defined using the following syntax rules:  

- [http://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/object-literal/](http://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/object-literal/)  
- A colon separates property name from value.
- A comma separates each name-value pair from the next.
- There should be no comma after the last name-value pair.
