Process Compendium 2004-2010 is a collection of work and record of process by Casey Reas, co-founder of Processing, presented and created entirely in Processing. 

An Element is a simple machine that is comprised of a Form and one or more Behaviors. A Process defines an environment for Elements and determines how the relationships between the Elements are visualized. For instance, Element 1 takes the form of a circle and one of its behaviors moves it along a straight line at a constant speed. Process 4 fills a surface with Element 1 and draws a line between elements while they overlap. Each Process is a short text that defines a space to explore through multiple interpretations.

# Exercise 1: Working with Sol LeWitt
## "The idea becomes a machine that makes the art"
## Exploration
### Drawings based on rules
Follow the rules below. Complete your drawing on a given paper and post it to the class wall using masking tape. Don't forget to sign each work with your name.
	
- Drawing 1, [Sol LeWitt's wall drawing #95](http://massmoca.org/event/walldrawing95/), 1971 (15 mins): 
>On a wall (paper) divided vertically into fifteen equal parts, vertical lines, not straight, using four colors in all one-, two-, three-, and four-part combinations.
>
Material: Colored pencil on white paper
>
Centre Pompidou, Paris
Musée national d’art moderne/Centre de création industrielle

- Drawing 2, Sol LeWitt's wall drawing #118, 1971 (15 mins):  
	>On a wall (paper) surface, any continuous stretch of wall/paper, using a hard pencil, place fifty points at random. 
The points should be evenly distributed over the area of the wall/paper.  All of the points should be connected by straight lines.
	>
Material: Pencil on paper  
>	
Boston Museum

### Creating your rules
- (20 min): each participant should create directions for a drawing. The artist may stipulate the media, size, tool(s), color(s), shape(s), placement of all elements, or only some. Follow your rules to draw one by yourself, then post your rule (not your drawing) onto the wall.

- (20 min) : Choose a rule from the wall which a fellow artist created, and copy that rule (you can take a photo). Then create a drawing based on it. Once you are done, post your drawing under your chosen rule.

## Sol LeWitt	

**Sol LeWitt** (b.1928, Hartford, CT; d. 2007, New York) was a leading figure of Minimalism and pioneer of Conceptual art. 
LeWitt has been the subject of numerous one-artist exhibitions and his work is held in public collections worldwide. In 2008, MASS MoCA opened [Sol LeWitt: A Wall Drawing Retrospective](http://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/), which will remain on view through 2033.

- Sol Lewitt's CV from [Lisson Gallery](http://www.lissongallery.com/artists/sol-lewitt).

- [Sol LeWitt exhibition at Paula Cooper Gallery](https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/sol-lewitt-2016-09-08/installation-views)


LeWitt began to create works that utilized simple and impersonal geometric forms, exploring repetition and variations of a basic form or line as a way to achieve complex works. Perhaps most importantly, he evolved a working method for creating artworks based on simple directions, works that could be executed by others rather than the artist. The fertility of this approach is demonstrated by the aesthetic richness and variety of the wall drawings, none of which were drawn by him. LeWitt rejects the notion of art as a unique and precious object. Formulated from an initial idea outlined in a diagrammatic sketch accompanied by a set of instructions, his works are installed on the wall of the gallery or museum by a team of assistants, who rigorously follow the artist’s directives. Some instructions are simple and straightforward, and some are long and complex. By placing his drawings directly on the wall of the gallery or museum, LeWitt merges his drawing with the architecture, while also calling into questions ideas about permanence, value, and conservation. *- This description from [Guggenheim museum.](https://www.guggenheim.org/arts-curriculum/topic/sol-lewitt)*

>LeWitt's wall drawings are executed by assistants from the artist's instructions. In this work, the lines are all equally spaced and drawn in coloured pencil. Each colour corresponds to a different type of line: yellow for horizontal, black for vertical, red for diagonal from left to right, and blue for diagonal from right to left. The lines are drawn in all possible combinations in fifteen rectangles, becoming denser from left to right. Through this layering, new colours and complex patterns emerge from LeWitt's simple set of rules.

## Sol LeWitt's thought
> **When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.**  

>**The ideas need not be complex. Most ideas that are successful are ludicrously simple. Successful ideas generally have the appearance of simplicity because they seem inevitable. In terms of ideas the artist is free even to surprise himself. Ideas are discovered by intuition.**

>**To work with a plan that is preset is one way of avoiding subjectivity. It also obviates the necessity of designing each work in turn. The plan would design the work. Some plans would require millions of variations, and some a limited number, but both are finite. Other plans imply infinity.** 

>**When an artist uses a multiple modular method he usually chooses a simple and readily available form. The form itself is of very limited importance; it becomes the grammar for the total work. In fact, it is best that the basic unit be deliberately uninteresting so that it may more easily become an intrinsic part of the entire work. Using complex basic forms only disrupts the unity of the whole. Using a simple form repeatedly narrows the field of the work and concentrates the intensity to the arrangement of the form. This arrangement becomes the end while the form becomes the means.**

>**If the artist carries through his idea and makes it into visible form, then all the steps in the process are of importance. The idea itself, even if not made visual, is as much a work of art as any finished product. All intervening steps –scribbles, sketches, drawings, failed works, models, studies, thoughts, conversations– are of interest.  Those that show the thought process of the artist are sometimes more interesting than the final product.**

## Introduction: Tool - 'P5.js'
It is expected that students may be beginner-level with coding Javascript. It is recommended to work through some of the online tutorials or courses listed here. 

Experience with [Processing](https://processing.org/) may be an advantage, but please note that we will use P5.js. P5.js has many similar functions to Processing, but it is based in the Javascript language, whereas Processing has a different language that is derived from Java.
