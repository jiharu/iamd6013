## Week 9
# Artificial Nature

- Theory: Artificial Nature & Case Studies

<!--	***“What are components and mechanisms of CAS?”***  
	***“Where can we discover CAS?””***  
	***"Which factors of CAS could be interesting for artmaking?"***  
	***"Is emergence important? Why?"***  -->

>“Mankind has a long history of attempting to map the mechanics of contemporary technology on to the workings of nature, trying to understand the latter in terms of the former.”
- Christopher Langton,‘Artificial Life’, 1989.

# Motivation
>You may remember experiences from your childhood, such as playing with your fingers in the flow of a river, or in the path of small marching insects, to alter the emerging patterns. Such play is a direct interaction with complex systems, provoking deep insights and aesthetically fascinating natural patterns; ludic investigation considered as an infinite game. We approach this subject as trans-disciplinary research through the development of media-art projects. - Artificial Nature

## Goal
**Construct an aesthetic unity in which art, science, play, and life integrate into a single fulfilled experience.**

# Attributes of Artificial Natures

## 1. Computation as an Art Medium
The integration of algorithmic and dynamic properties of computation makes possible an unprecedented open-ended field of autonomy.

### Generative Art: Autonomy, Interactivity and Open-ness
>“Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist uses **a system that operates with some degree of autonomy**, and contributes to or results in a completed work of art. **Systems may include natural language instructions, biological or chemical processes, computer programs, machines, self-organizing materials, mathematical operations, and other procedural inventions**.”
- Philip Galanter, 'What Is Generative Art', 2003 

### Computation as extension of Nature
The metaphor of automation as an extension of body/mind can be extrapolated to computation as an extension of nature, since the properties of dynamic autonomy and open interaction are immanent to both. 

### Computation and *Techné*
The meaning of art over history has been reducing its scope until it became completely separated from science and technology, and has almost forgotten their shared origins.

Etymology: **Art** is derived via old French from Latin **ars** and **ars** is a translation of the Greek **τέχνη (techné)**; a root shared by the world **technology**.

>“There was a time when it was not technology alone that bore the name techné. Once that revealing which brings forth truth into the splendor of radiant appearance was also called techné... Once there was a time when the bringing forth of the true into the beautiful was called techné. The poiésis of the fine arts was also called techné.”
- Martin Heidegger, 'The Question Concerning Technology', 1982, Originally Published in 1954


>‘Beauty is truth, truth beauty,’—that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know”
- John Keats,‘Ode on a Grecian Urn’, 1819.

## 2. Natural Systems as Art Material
- An artist needs to understand nature-like phenomena in order to create a ***nature-like art work***: nature is not only a most powerful inspirational source, it is also the original creative force of which we are made.

- For artificial natures, in terms of a relation of art to nature, the traditionally mimetic role of art must evolve into creating a world in itself as an embodiment of natural mechanisms based on computational processes, along with multi-modal expression: from representing **how nature** ***looks*** to expressing through the manner of **how nature** ***works***. 

## 3. Immersive Finesse
- ***"How participants experience the immersive art work intuitively with a full sense of integration?"***

- ***"How artists express their free ideas, imaginations, and emotions through computational rules of complex natural systems with rigorous technical proficiency?"***

The quality, intensity, or fulfillment of being immersed depends on the immersants making a mental transition. As much as technology can create physical cues to catalyze this transition, ***the relationship between the artistic content and immersant’s frame of mind and cultural context is equally if not more important.***

>“Immersion can be an intellectually stimulating process; however, in the present as in the past, in most cases immersion is mentally absorbing and a process, a change, a passage from one mental state to another. It is characterized by diminishing critical distance to what is shown and increasing emotional involvement in what is happening.” - Grau, O.. Virtual Art: From Illusion to Immersion (Leonardo Books). The MIT Press, 2004.
