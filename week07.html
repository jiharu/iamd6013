## CAS
[wikipedia: cas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system)  

The study of complex adaptive systems is highly interdisciplinary and blends insights from the natural and social sciences to develop system-level models and insights that allow for heterogeneous agents, phase transition, and emergent behavior. 

The study of CAS focuses on complex, emergent and macroscopic properties of the system. John H. Holland said that CAS "are systems that have a large numbers of components, often called agents, that interact and adapt or learn."

Typical examples of complex adaptive systems include: climate; cities; firms; markets; governments; industries; ecosystems; social networks; power grids; animal swarms; traffic flows; social insect (e.g. ant) colonies; the brain and the immune system; and the cell and the developing embryo. Human social group-based endeavors, such as political parties, communities, geopolitical organizations, war, and terrorist networks are also considered CAS. The internet and cyberspace—composed, collaborated, and managed by a complex mix of human–computer interactions, is also regarded as a complex adaptive system. CAS can be hierarchical, but more often exhibit aspects of "self-organization."

## Complexity and Emergence

Complexity in CAS results from the fact that these systems contain emergent properties. According to Holland, emergence is a distinguishing feature of CAS. Emergence can generally be defined as the relation between properties existing on two separate yet interconnected strata, where the lower strata provides elementary substrate on which the higher strata “grows” as the aggregate of the elements of lower strata. Crucially, aggregate features at higher strata are not reducible to lower strata — they cannot be explained as summation of properties or elements of lower strata.

## Self-orgnization
The spontaneous emergence of global coherence out of local interactions.

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization) 

Self-organization, also called (in the social sciences) spontaneous order, is a process where some form of overall order arises from local interactions between parts of an initially disordered system. The process is spontaneous, not needing control by any external agent. It is often triggered by random fluctuations, amplified by positive feedback. The resulting organization is wholly decentralized, distributed over all the components of the system. As such, the organization is typically robust and able to survive or self-repair substantial perturbation. Chaos theory discusses self-organization in terms of islands of predictability in a sea of chaotic unpredictability.

Self-organization occurs in many physical, chemical, biological, robotic, and cognitive systems. Examples of self-organization include crystallization, thermal convection of fluids, chemical oscillation, animal swarming, neural circuits, and artificial neural networks. 

### Principles
The cybernetician William Ross Ashby formulated the original principle of self-organization in 1947. It states that any deterministic dynamic system automatically evolves towards a state of equilibrium that can be described in terms of an attractor in a basin of surrounding states. Once there, the further evolution of the system is constrained to remain in the attractor. This constraint implies a form of mutual dependency or coordination between its constituent components or subsystems. In Ashby's terms, each subsystem has adapted to the environment formed by all other subsystems.

The cybernetician Heinz von Foerster formulated the principle of "order from noise" in 1960. It notes that self-organization is facilitated by random perturbations ("noise") that let the system explore a variety of states in its state space. This increases the chance that the system will arrive into the basin of a "strong" or "deep" attractor, from which it then quickly enters the attractor itself. The biophysicist Henri Atlan developed this concept by proposing the principle of "complexity from noise" (French: le principe de complexité par le bruit) first in the 1972 book L'organisation biologique et la théorie de l'information and then in the 1979 book Entre le cristal et la fumée. The thermodynamicist Ilya Prigogine formulated a similar principle as "order through fluctuations"[16] or "order out of chaos". It is applied in the method of simulated annealing for problem solving and machine learning.

### Dynamic systems

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) 

![lorenzOscillator](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Lorenz_attractor_yb.svg/440px-Lorenz_attractor_yb.svg.png)  
The Lorenz attractor arises in the study of the Lorenz Oscillator, a dynamical system.  

In mathematics, a dynamical system is a system in which a function describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space. Examples include the mathematical models that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, and the number of fish each springtime in a lake.

At any given time, a dynamical system has a state given by a tuple of real numbers (a vector) that can be represented by a point in an appropriate state space (a geometrical manifold). The evolution rule of the dynamical system is a function that describes what future states follow from the current state. Often the function is deterministic, that is, for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state. However, some systems are stochastic, in that random events also affect the evolution of the state variables.

In physics, a dynamical system is described as a "particle or ensemble of particles whose state varies over time and thus obeys differential equations involving time derivatives." In order to make a prediction about the system’s future behavior, an analytical solution of such equations or their integration over time through computer simulation is realized.

The study of dynamical systems is the focus of dynamical systems theory, which has applications to a wide variety of fields such as mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, economics, and medicine. Dynamical systems are a fundamental part of chaos theory, logistic map dynamics, bifurcation theory, the self-assembly process, and the edge of chaos concept.


## Multi-agent systems (agent-based models)

### Agent
An autonomous agent interacts within an environment populated by other agents, but behaves independently without taking direct commands from other agents nor a global planner or leader. Agent-based models typically operate in parallel within a spatial environment, in which agents are often (but not always) mobile, but interactions are usually limited to local distances. Because of this, with a few simple rules rather complex collective behavior can emerge.

The agent abstraction has arisen somewhat independently in different fields, thus the definition of an agent can vary widely. However the following components are usually present:

- Properties: Persistent but variable features of an agent, such as size, color, speed, direction, energy level, and so on.  
- Input: Limited capabilities of sensing (or receiving messages from) the environment.  
- Output: Limited capabilities of performing actions on (or sending messages to) the environment, or its own properties. Typically this includes the ability to move through space.  
- Processing: An information processing capacity to select actions in response to inputs. This capacity may also include information storage (memory).  
- Motivations: The agent may also incorporate explicit goals or purposes in the form of self-evaluation and self-adaptation; or these may be implict in the design of the processing algorithm.  

As a biological approximation, an agent could refer to anything from individual proteins, viruses, cells, bacteria, organisms, or population groups. Agent systems also share similarities with particle systems.

### Tortoises and Vehicles
In the 1950's Cyberneticist Grey Walter pioneered the engineering of agents, as early examples of autonomous robots, with his “tortoises”. Remarkably, this direction of research was largely forgotten as efforts in artificial intelligence concentrated on symbolic thinking.

![tortoise](http://www.rutherfordjournal.org/images/020101-05.jpg)

Nevertheless, Walter’s tortoises inspired the turtle graphics of Logo, the situated robotics of Rodney Brooks, the flocking behaviors of Craig Reynolds, and Valentino Braitenberg’s Vehicles.

>A Braitenberg vehicle is an agent that can autonomously move around. It has primitive sensors (measuring some stimulus at a point) and wheels (each driven by its own motor) that function as actuators or effectors. A sensor, in the simplest configuration, is directly connected to an effector, so that a sensed signal immediately produces a movement of the wheel. Depending on how sensors and wheels are connected, the vehicle exhibits different behaviors (which can be goal-oriented). [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle)

Cyberneticist Valentino Braitenberg argues that his extraordinarily simple mechanical vehicles manifest behaviors that appear identifiable as fear, aggression, love, foresight, and optimism. The vehicle idea was a thought experiment conceived to show that complex, apparently purposive behaviour did not need to depend on complex representations of the environment inside a creature or agents brain. In fact simply by reacting to the environment in a consistent manner was more than enough to explain the low level reactive behaviours exhibited by many animals.
