# Special Focus Research and Innovation: Artificial Nature 

***Artificial Nature*** is a form of computational generative art creating artificial life ecosystems as immersive environments. The contradictory notions of artificiality and nature do not create an opposition, but rather converge human cultural new media expression into nature’s creative engine, inspired by the way nature works. Choosing an holistic approach, this course fosters a reciprocal engagement of concept, theory, and art practice based on a trans-disciplinary implementation, seeking a reconciliation between artificial subjectivity and natural objectivity.   
 

Participants can find information about the Artificial Nature installation series from the website: [http://artificialnature.net](http://artificialnature.net)     


The course challenges participants to explore open-ended approaches to its relevant subjects including but not limited to: new media, computation, natural systems, complex adaptive systems, artificial life art, evolutionary biology & algorithms, contemporary art, and creating immersive environments in virtual or mixed reality. Finally, the course invites its participants to experiment and to create their version of artificial nature to broaden and to examine their research-creation boundaries.    


The class is also open for collaboration with students from the York University Digital Media course Artificial Life, Generative Art & Creative Code, run simultaneously by the other collaborator in the Artificial Nature project. We may hold class together several times.   


As a significant course outcome, the many different kinds of artificial nature projects created by course participants, in collaborative, perforated, or porous forms, will be exhibited in one of the OCAD U exhibition areas.
