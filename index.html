## Description 

Artificial Nature is a form of computational generative art creating artificial life ecosystems as immersive environments. The contradictory notions of artificiality and nature do not create an opposition, but rather converge human cultural new media expression into nature’s creative engine, inspired by the way nature works. Choosing an holistic approach, this course fosters a reciprocal engagement of concept, theory, and art practice based on a trans-disciplinary implementation, seeking a reconciliation between artificial subjectivity and natural objectivity.  
  
Participants can find information about the Artificial Nature installation series from the website: http://artificialnature.net  
  
The course challenges participants to explore open-ended approaches to its relevant subjects including but not limited to: new media, computation, natural systems, complex adaptive systems, artificial life art, evolutionary biology & algorithms, contemporary art, and creating immersive environments in virtual or mixed reality. Finally, the course invites its participants to experiment and to create their version of artificial nature to broaden and to examine their research-creation boundaries. 

Students meet weekly for guided discussions on the theoretical and practical issues surrounding a common theme/interest related to practices and disciplines. In this advanced graduate seminar/studio, students develop the position, methodological framework and aesthetic context appropriate for their work. The course structures students' research and production as an iterative and discursive process, supplemented by the analysis of relevant texts, visits from guest lecturers, critiques and hands-on workshops.

As a significant course outcome, the many different kinds of artificial nature projects created by course participants, in collaborative, perforated, or porous forms, will be exhibited in one of the OCAD U exhibition areas. In 2021, we will examine alternative ways to exhibit responding to the Pandemic such as VR or XR exhibition forms. 

The class is also open for collaboration with the Alice Lab from York University, run by the other collaborator in the Artificial Nature project. 

<!--The class is also open for collaboration with students from the York University Digital Media course Artificial Life, Generative Art & Creative Code, run simultaneously by the other collaborator in the Artificial Nature project. We may hold class together several times.-->

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Have examined theoretical and historical background surrounding artificial nature, incorporating key concepts to develop understanding and construct their own map, as a tool to navigate related fields including a) computational generative art and new media, b) artificial life ecosystems and contemporary art, and 3) interactive & immersive systems and aesthetic experience.  
- Have developed awareness and experience in the methodological practice of developing naturally-inspired systems in code (using Javascript), translating theoretical understanding into practical making in a trans-disciplinary conjunction of art, coding, and natural (physical, chemical, and biological) systems, by applying these methodologies effectively in creative practice.  
- Be able to interpret and reflect aesthetically and critically on perspectives toward the creative engines of nature, via examination of the relations between new computational media and bio-inspired systems.  
- Articulate an aesthetic context appropriate for their work by creative conjunction/derailment with new ideas and elements, based on their personal interpretation and critical approaches toward artificiality and nature, and apply these critical interpretations through a progressively-refined art making experience to develop further their art practice research.

## Grading/Assignment
<!--#### 15% participation

Participation incorporates timely and attentive presence in class, contributions to tutorial discussions, awareness of issues in readings and work in progress, the ability to relate tutorial issues to the broader concerns of the course, and openness and engagement in continuous growth through the work.-->

#### 1st deliverable: Planning including a short video presentation (30%)

In January, each student will research to plan for an alternative way of preparing an exhibition as a web documentation including a short video introduction (around 3 mins) of their own research theme responding to topics of the classes, including leading questions to ignite wider discussion. Projects may be individual or collaborative. 

#### 2nd deliverable: Progress report (30%)

It can be an archive or a tutorial or both to show your structural approaches from your plan to your final artwork. It is recommended to include your key questions and relations to the themes of class topics, along with your approaches/analyses, to construct your personal philosophical and/or artist stance, perspective, and trajectory. 

#### 3rd deliverable: Final art project as an alternative exhibition + an artist statement (40%)

The class culminates with a new media art installation in an alternative form such as VR or XR based on students' individual interpretations of artificiality and nature. The final web documentation will include final work images/videos/or others and your artist statement.

## Supplies
Your laptop and notebook.

## Student Preparation / Workload Expectations

You can anticipate that studying and completing class will require at a minimum 2–3 hours of time outside of class per week for every hour of in class time per week.

## Teaching & Learning Methods

We will use a variety of learning strategies in this class including project work, discussions, presentations, tutorials, and lectures.

### Coding expectations:

It is expected that students may be beginner-level with coding Javascript. It is recommended to work through some of the online tutorials or courses listed here in advance:

- [p5.js.org/learn](https://p5js.org/learn/)  
	- Getting Started.  
	- p5.js Overview.  
	- Coordinate System and Shapes.  
	- Program Flow.  
- [LinkedIn tutorial link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/collections/6572478668336058368?u=56972265)  
	- Coding for Visual Learners: Learning JavaScript from Scratch with Engin Arslan.
- Coding Train
	- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWkPOfnGsw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWkPOfnGsw)

	
Experience with Processing may be an advantage, but please note that we will use P5.js. P5.js has many similar functions to Processing, but it is based in the Javascript language, whereas Processing has a different language that is derived from Java.

### Teamwork:

Students can work individually or in collaborative groups, however all students are expected to complete the course with a basic level of understanding of the coding/computational components.

## Class schedule

OCAD U has a twelve­class semester followed by a two­week assessment period for exams and critiques. Students must be available for the duration of this period.
