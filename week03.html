### FormSynth evolutionary drawing system  
An experimental drawing system created by William Latham and used by him to produce many works between 1984-1987. This was a system for drawing on paper and not on the computer. The rules, sphere, cone, bulge, scope, and so on, were typed out, and Latham applied them by hand. Repeated application of the rules created an evolutionary tree of complex forms. 1984.

### Hand-drawn Form Synth by William Latham  
First attempts by William to formalise the Form Synth process – a rule based drawing process – in the form of a flow diagram. Anticipating a move to software of his ideas. 1985.

### FormSynth basic program  
Programmed in BBC Basic, the computer gave William randomly selected drawing instructions from the Form Synth rule set. William used his brain as the graphics software to imagine what the forms looked like and then drew them. 1985.

East Gallery at Norwich University of the Arts was the first art gallery venue worldwide to exhibit Mutator VR, which used original software modelled on the processes of evolution to blend organic imagery with state-of-the-art, real-time computer animation, creating a highly immersive and original audience experience.

## Evolutionary Systems
There have been more than four decades of computational systems inspired by natural evolution. It has become a major field of machine learning and optimization. Beyond AI, it has been used in hardware and circuit design, robotics, and more recently in industrial design and architecture. It has of course also been deeply explored in art and music.

[An introduction of evolutionary systems, from DATT4950 York University.](http://grrrwaaa.github.io/courses/datt4950/evo.html)  

### Heredity and variation: aesthetic selection
- Interactive selection. Pioneered by Dawkins' [Biomorphs program](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/science-environment-36367745/richard-dawkins-discusses-biomorphs-in-1991) and Karl Sims' [Galapagos](http://www.karlsims.com/galapagos/), [Genetic Images](https://vimeo.com/7723361), in which several candidates are presented to human observers, who apply the selection manually. Also known as **aesthetic selection**. A problem here is that the human becomes the bottleneck of evolution, constraining population sizes and rates of evolution to very small scales. It may arguably also tend toward selecting for the aesthetic average rather than the remarkable.

	- An interesting variation is to make the selection continuous and implicit. Jon McCormack's [Eden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrww68pnqqM) measured fitness globally according to how long gallery visitors remained in front of a particular evolving sub-population.
	- [A-Volve](http://www.interface.ufg.ac.at/christa-laurent/WORKS/FRAMES/FrameSet.html) from Christa SOMMERER & Laurent MIGNONNEAU, 1994.  
	- [Electric Sheep](https://electricsheep.org/#/about) using [The Flame Algorithm](https://flam3.com/) by [Scott Drave](https://scottdraves.com/sheep.html), the software was originally written in 1992.   

- A viability-oriented form of artificial evolution may be used for more theoretical and aesthetic branches of artificial life research. The viability measure arises as an emergent property of underlying laws of the world, such as the requirement to maintain energetic/metabolic balance or to maintain structural integrity, as well as the collective effects of multiple species and non-living dynamics within the environment. For this reason it is sometimes referred to as ecosystemic selection. See discussion here. This may still incorporate indirect interaction from human agents if desired.

### Artificial evolution
- Genetic representation: Genotypes
- Development & population: Phenotypes
- Selection: Fitness function vs. Aesthetic vs Artificial-Natural or Random
- Variation of new generation: Mutation (sexual/asexual) & Crossover (sexual)

## Exploration on Form Synth Ideas
### 1-1. Creating a rule of growth (morphogenesis) for a new species (20 min)
- Define the initial status on paper: form & development	
	- Form
		- A small numbers of simple forms.
		<!--- Form/dimension: 2D (e.g., triangle, circle, square..) or 3D (e.g., box, cone, sphere..)-->
	- Development	
		- Behaviors/transformations || deformations || mathematical functions; e.g. bulge, beak, slice, scoop, rotate, bend, twist, add, subtract, multiply, etc.  
		- Methods of choosing among elements: e.g. sequence, dice rolls, free choice, etc.	
	- The final rule should be in a written form of instructions or a flow chart.

### 1-2. Test your rule by creating a population of phenotype expressions (30 min)
- ***Create a population of development drawings*** based on your defined rules.	
	- Your rule is the genetic information (**genotype**) corresponding to your drawing (**phenotype**).

- Refining your rule:
	- If you are not satisfied with the results, go back to step 1 and modify your rule.
	- If you are satisfied with your results, post your rule and drawings in [the google link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yxj_69uLoy9riQRG8dqul_cejXSUS_vW45xeYmaoC7s/edit?usp=sharing). Don't forget to add your name. 
 

### 2. Breeding the population with an evolutionary approach (30 min)

- Choose the parent(s): select among your population of drawings (1-2), which ones will become parents to new offspring. 

- Heredity: create a new population of offspring drawings using your rule, in which each drawing is a variation of a selected parent. The offspring should mostly follow the same genetic choices within the rule as the parent (asexual reproduction), but with some variations (mutations).
- Variation: you may use these methods:
	- Random selection	 	
	- Aesthetic selection
		- By artist(s)
		- By participant(s)  
	- Artificial Natural selection	
		- By system to offer environmental conditions   	
	- Fitness/viability selection (function)  	

- Continue several generations of heredity and variation to create a family tree. If you are happy, post your drawings under your rule in [the google link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yxj_69uLoy9riQRG8dqul_cejXSUS_vW45xeYmaoC7s/edit?usp=sharing).
	
### 3-1. Selecting a rule (30 min)
- Go to [the google link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yxj_69uLoy9riQRG8dqul_cejXSUS_vW45xeYmaoC7s/edit?usp=sharing) where defined rules are posted by your fellow artists, and find a rule you like. 
	
### 3-2. Modifying the rule & creating your expression (30 min)
- If you are satisfied with your drawing from the rule you chose, post your drawing in the [the google link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yxj_69uLoy9riQRG8dqul_cejXSUS_vW45xeYmaoC7s/edit?usp=sharing). Don't forget to add your name.
- If you are not satisfied with your drawing, modify the rule to make it more interesting for you. Then create new expressions based on your modified rule. Continue until you are satisfied with the results, posting both the modified rule and the expressions in [the google link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yxj_69uLoy9riQRG8dqul_cejXSUS_vW45xeYmaoC7s/edit?usp=sharing). Don't forget to add your name.
